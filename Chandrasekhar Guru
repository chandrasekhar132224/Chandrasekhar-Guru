Work Experience: Associate Software Engineer | Capital One | May 2024 - Present | Tampa, FL. Developed and optimized secure financial microservices using Python, Flask, FastAPI, and AWS for Capital One’s high-volume transaction systems. Built and integrated REST APIs for authentication, account operations, and compliance workflows, improving system reliability and performance. Automated deployments with CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions/Jenkins) and strengthened platform security following PCI, IAM, and API governance standards. Enhanced data processing using optimized SQL queries, improving analytics performance for internal financial tools.

AI/ML Research Assistant | Southern Arkansas University | Jan 2024 - Mar 2024 | United States. Developed ML-based forecasting systems and computer vision applications including ARIMA financial prediction, NLP-based recommendation engines, and a YOLOv8-powered metal plate defect detection system. Designed custom augmentation pipelines, trained high-accuracy models, built inference APIs using Flask, and integrated React frontends for real-time inspection. Deployed ML systems using Docker and AWS EC2, contributing to academic research outcomes.

Software Engineer |HCLTech| Dec 2021 - Aug 2023 | Chennai, India. Developed full-stack applications using Flask, FastAPI, and React. Created secure REST APIs for authentication, dashboards, streaming, and transactions using Redis, RabbitMQ, and Elasticsearch. Leveraged AWS Lambda for serverless execution achieving improved scalability. Built CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions and Jenkins, supporting rapid deployment across environments.

Software Developer |Adobe| Jan 2020 - Oct 2021 | Hyderabad, India. Developed backend services with Flask and FastAPI, optimized SQL queries for high-volume analytics, automated daily data pipelines using cron jobs, and integrated cloud services for enterprise workflows. Wrote end-to-end tests using PyTest and ensured API stability through debugging and static code validation.

📜 Certifications & Achievements: AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner – AWS (2020) Python for Everybody – Coursera (2018) JavaScript for Web Development – Udemy (2019) Academic ML Project Achievements — SAU (2025)

Notable Projects: Metal Plate Hole Detection Model (Computer Vision) Built a full pipeline for threaded/normal hole detection using YOLOv8. Performed data augmentation (100+ images), trained custom object detection models, created a Flask inference API, integrated React for visualization, and deployed using Docker. System detects holes, classifies them, validates positions, and returns annotated outputs.

Precious Metal Price Forecasting (Time Series) Implemented ARIMA-based price prediction using 5-year historical data. Conducted data cleaning, feature engineering, train-test modeling, and accuracy evaluation. Visualized forecasts and automated the entire prediction pipeline.

Multimedia Recommendation Engine (NLP) Built a content-recommendation system using web scraping, text preprocessing, embedding generation, and cosine similarity. Delivered >95% accuracy. Created FastAPI services for recommendation delivery and containerized the system for deployment.
